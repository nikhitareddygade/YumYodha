            <h2>Butter Chicken</h2>
            <p>Butter Chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a popular North Indian dish renowned for its rich and creamy sauce. It
            typically consists of tender chicken pieces marinated in yogurt and spices, cooked in a tomato-based sauce enriched with
            butter, cream, and aromatic spices such as garam masala, ginger, and garlic. The dish is known for its mild yet
            flavorful taste, often garnished with fresh cilantro and served with naan bread or rice.
