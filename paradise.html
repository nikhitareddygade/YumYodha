            <h2>Hyderabadi Biryani</h2>
            <p>Hyderabadi Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish originating from Hyderabad, India, renowned for its rich
            culinary heritage. It typically features basmati rice cooked with marinated meat (usually chicken, mutton, or goat),
            blended with aromatic spices such as saffron, cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom. The dish is layered and slow-cooked in a
            sealed pot (dum), allowing the flavors to meld together perfectly. Hyderabadi Biryani is often garnished with fried
            onions, fresh cilantro, and served with raita (yogurt sauce) or mirchi ka salan (spicy gravy).</p>
