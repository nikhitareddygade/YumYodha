            <h2>Mini Banana Pancakes</h2>
            <p>Mini banana pancakes are a delightful twist on traditional pancakes, featuring mashed ripe bananas mixed into the batter
            for added sweetness and flavor. These small-sized pancakes are typically made with a mixture of flour, milk (or
            buttermilk), eggs, baking powder, and a touch of sugar. They are cooked on a griddle or skillet until golden brown and
            fluffy. Mini banana pancakes are often served with maple syrup, honey, fresh berries, or a dollop of yogurt for a
            delicious and wholesome breakfast or snack.
