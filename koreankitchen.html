            <h2>Bibimbap</h2>
            <p>Bibimbap is a popular Korean dish known for its colorful presentation and diverse flavors. It typically consists of warm
            white rice topped with various saut√©ed and seasoned vegetables such as spinach, mushrooms, carrots, bean sprouts, and
            zucchini, along with thinly sliced beef or tofu. A fried egg and spicy gochujang (red chili paste) often accompany the
            dish, adding richness and depth of flavor.Bibimbap is served in a heated stone bowl (dolsot), which crisps the rice at the bottom, providing a delightful
            contrast in texture.
